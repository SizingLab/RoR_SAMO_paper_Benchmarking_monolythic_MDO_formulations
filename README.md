# Code for Replication of Results

##  Benchmarking of monolithic MDO formulations and derivative computation techniques using OpenMDAO

The paper results were obtained with Python 3.6 and OpenMDAO 2.6.0.

To start the computation and plots, run the benchmark_main.py file.

Be aware of the computation times on typical laptop:

- Sellar tests ~ 10 mins
- EMA design tests ~ 1 hour
- Large scale EMA design tests ~ 3 days
